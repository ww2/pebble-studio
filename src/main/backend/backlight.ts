 * capture keeps it bright by tapping a button every second; we mirror that. While

 *   1. reads the qemu HMP **monitor** port from /tmp/pb-emulator.json
 *      (`<platform>.<version>.qemu.monitor`) — THROUGH the same Shell abstraction
 *      bootEmulator uses, so it works on a Windows+WSL host where the file lives
 *      in the WSL filesystem and Node (on Windows) can't read that POSIX path.
 *   2. opens a TCP socket to 127.0.0.1:<monitor>, writes `sendkey left\n`
 *      (a Back press = backlight wake), and closes.
 *
 * A Back press is harmless on a watchface but can navigate inside an app — that
 * caveat is surfaced in the Settings UI, not here.
