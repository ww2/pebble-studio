/**
 * Real-boot orchestration for the qemu-pebble emulator (Task 1.5).
 *
 * APPROACH 1 (empirically verified to work): we let the `pebble` tool own the
 * whole emulator stack (qemu + pypkjs + websockify) via
 *   `pebble emu-control --emulator <platform> --vnc`
 *
 * The pebble-tool spawns:
 *   - qemu-pebble with `-vnc :1` (raw RFB on localhost:5901)
 *   - pypkjs (phone-sim websocket bridge)
 *   - websockify --heartbeat=30 6080 localhost:5901  (ws://localhost:6080/)
 * and records pids/ports in /tmp/pb-emulator.json.
 *
 * Because the tool reuses the running qemu/pypkjs (by pid, from that json file)
 * for subsequent discrete commands (`pebble install`, `pebble emu-button ...`),
 * those commands hit the SAME running emulator and do NOT tear down the VNC.
 *
 * The one obstacle the spike found: the tool's VNC boot passes
 *   `-L <sdk-root>/toolchain/lib/pc-bios`
 * for the qemu keymap, but that dir has no `en-us` keymap, so qemu aborts.
 * We pre-seed that keymap (idempotent) before booting.
 *
 * TWO HOSTS, ONE INTERFACE (Task: WSL-aware boot):
 * Every shell operation goes through a `Shell` abstraction with two impls:
 *   - native: `bash -lc "<cmdline>"` directly (Linux/macOS host).
 *   - wsl:    `wsl.exe -- bash -lc "<cmdline>"` (Windows host driving WSL2).
 * The cmdlines are identical; only the launcher differs. WSL2 forwards
 * localhost ports to the Windows host, so readiness checks stay on localhost.
 */

  // "websockify" in the TARGET's argv, but our own cmdline contains the literal
  // "[w]ebsockify", which does NOT match.
  //   * websockify / emu-control / pypkjs run as `python …` so `-f` (argv match)
  //     is mandatory.
  //   * qemu ALSO needs `-f '[q]emu-pebble'` (argv match), NOT `-x qemu-pebble`
  //     (comm match): the time-shim wrapper launches qemu as a `#!/bin/sh` script,
  //     so until it `exec`s the real binary its comm is `sh`/`dash` — `-x` would
  //     miss it and leave a stale process holding RFB :5901, causing the next
  //     boot to die on "address already in use". The argv carries the wrapper
  //     PATH (…/qemu-pebble) in both the pre- and post-exec states, so `-f` reaps
  //     it either way.
  //
  // ORDER MATTERS: the `emu-control --vnc` session SUPERVISES qemu and respawns it
  // if killed alone, so we kill the supervisor FIRST, then qemu/websockify/pypkjs,
  // then `pebble kill` for any state-file pids. We sweep TWICE (with a short settle)
  // to catch anything that respawned in the race window, then delete the state file.
  //
  // ANCHORING (don't SIGKILL a stranger): each `-f` pattern must match ONLY our
  // stack. websockify in particular is the generic noVNC proxy — a bare
  // `[w]ebsockify` would kill an unrelated user's noVNC — so we anchor it to the
  // fixed ports OUR websockify always carries in its argv
  // (`websockify --heartbeat=30 6080 localhost:5901`). emu-control / qemu-pebble /
  // `-m pypkjs` are already uniquely ours. `pebble kill` is BOUNDED by coreutils

  // otherwise hang stop/boot forever — SIGTERM at 5s, SIGKILL at 7s.
