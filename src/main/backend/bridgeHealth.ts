/**
 * Bridge health detection core (Task H1 — pure, unit-testable).
 *
 * Detects whether the qemu-pebble + pypkjs processes are still alive and
 * reachable by reading the emulator state file and probing the real process
 * table. Pure (no Electron, no polling loop, no fs reads) — all three
 * exported functions are fully unit-testable under vitest's node environment.
 *
 * Three responsibilities:
 *   1. parseBridgePids  — extract qemu.pid, pypkjs.pid, pypkjs.port from the
 *      /tmp/pb-emulator.json text (same read pattern as parsePhonesimPort in
 *      clayWindow.ts and parseMonitorPort in backend/backlight.ts).
 *   2. buildHealthCommand — assemble a quote-free bash one-liner that probes
 *      process states and the pypkjs TCP port, printing OK / DEAD pid /
 *      DEAD port to stdout.
 *   3. interpretHealth — parse that stdout into a structured verdict.
 *
 * CRITICAL: buildHealthCommand output MUST contain ZERO single-quote (') and
 * ZERO double-quote (") characters. The command is run via a Shell that on a
 * Windows host re-wraps it as `wsl.exe -- bash -lc "'bash' '-lc' '<cmd>'"`.
 * Any quote inside the command string is mangled across the two shell hops and
 * silently breaks only on the real .exe. (See pebbleCli.ts setTzOffsetCmd and
 * its no-quote test for the same constraint.)

/**
 * The three identifiers needed to assess bridge health:
 *   - qemuPid     — PID of the qemu-pebble process
 *   - pypkjsPid   — PID of the pypkjs phone-bridge process

/**
 * Build a quote-free bash one-liner that probes qemu + pypkjs health and
 * prints exactly ONE verdict token to stdout:
 *   OK        — the pypkjs port accepts a TCP connection (the bridge is
 *               serving), OR both processes are alive (not zombies).
 *   DEAD port — both PIDs are alive but the pypkjs TCP port is not reachable
 *               (pypkjs hung — debounced by the monitor).
 *   DEAD pid  — the port is NOT reachable AND a PID is gone/zombie (a real,
 *               confirmed death).
 *
 * WHY PORT-FIRST (the relaunch-loop fix, v0.0.13.10):
 *   The /proc/<pid> read is fragile across the Windows→wsl.exe→bash boundary —
 *   the first poll after boot intermittently read an empty state for a pid that
 *   was demonstrably alive (the qemu/pypkjs processes survived long after the
 *   app gave up looping). The old command checked the pid FIRST and
 *   short-circuited to `DEAD pid` before ever probing the port, so one bad read
 *   tore down a healthy, port-reachable bridge and triggered an infinite
 *   relaunch loop. A reachable pypkjs port is authoritative proof the bridge is
 *   alive, so we probe it FIRST: if it answers, the verdict is OK no matter what
 *   the pid reads say. `DEAD pid` is now only reachable when the port is ALSO
 *   down, which makes it a genuine death (and safe to fire without debounce).
 *
 * CRITICAL — the returned string MUST contain ZERO ' and ZERO " characters.
 * See module-level comment for why. All tokens are unquoted; the only
 * shell-special characters used are redirection (>/dev/null, 2>/dev/null),
 * semicolon (;), and parentheses — none of which require quoting and all of
 * which survive the WSL double-shell-hop unmangled.
 *
 * Implementation strategy (quote-free):
 *   Step 1: TCP probe via bare `(exec 3<>/dev/tcp/localhost/PORT) 2>/dev/null`.
 *           A refused connect fails immediately — no timeout wrapper needed.
 *           On success → echo OK and exit (port-reachable ⇒ alive, authoritative).
 *   Step 2 (only when the port is down): read a single state char from
 *           /proc/<pid>/status via grep+cut. `grep -m1 ^State /proc/<pid>/status
 *           | cut -f2 | cut -c1` yields one char (Z/S/R/…) or empty when the
 *           process is gone. If either QSTATE or PSTATE is empty or equals Z →
 *           DEAD pid; otherwise → DEAD port.
