/**
 * installRetry.ts — bounded retry for `pebble install` against the contended,
 * small-capacity pypkjs bridge.
 *
 * pypkjs accepts only a couple of simultaneous libpebble2 clients. The persistent
 * input helper holds one, and the optional emu-logs stream (`pebble logs`) holds
 * another. A drag-drop install opens yet another client; even though emu:install
 * pauses the log stream first (withAppLogPaused → stopAppLog), pypkjs may not have
 * released that just-killed client's slot before the install connects, so it
 * rejects the install with "unable to add pbw when emulator already running" and
 * surfaces a raw "failed (code 1)" to the user — yet the watchface still loads via
 * the boot-path reinstall. This is transient (the slot frees within a beat), so we
 * retry the install a few times. Any OTHER failure (corrupt pbw, ENOENT, …) is a
 * hard fault and is rethrown immediately — retrying it would only delay the error.
