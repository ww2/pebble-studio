// weatherCacheRefresh.ts — make weather watchfaces pick up new simulated weather
// immediately instead of waiting out their internal cache window.
//
// Weather faces commonly throttle their fetches — storing Date.now() in
// localStorage and refusing to refetch for some minutes. So after the user changes
// Pebble Studio's simulated weather, the watch keeps showing the stale values. The
// bundled `pebble_studio_clearcache` python module deletes those epoch-ms throttle
// stamps from pypkjs's on-disk localStorage (preserving the face's saved settings);
// relaunching the face then refetches on its handshake.
